- id 				|	INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
- username			|	TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL

	- gives ability to log out

- browse page
	- view all posts

- post page
	- text description of post
	- preview files
	- view downloadable files
	- comment on post
	- view other comments on post
	- ability to "collect" a post
	- have general author data shown

- create post
	- text description of post
	- file upload area

- update post
	- update text description
	- add or delete files to post
	- delete post feature
		- would have to remove the post from peoples collections
- favorite page
	- view all favorited posts


TO DO:
I have been looking into how to let a user upload files, and for them to be viewable by other users.
I'm making progress on it, but it is slow, this task was more complicated then I origionally thought it would be
the table for "collections" works, and I am working on a profile page where users can view their, and others, favorited posts

^^^^ minimum 
VVVV would like to do 

add a comment section to posts, users should be able to leave comments, and possibly respond to other's comments as well

create a file preview, so that a user knows what the file contains that they might download
I think I can get this to work for image and video files, but I have no idea how to do the in browser 3d model viewer stuff like Thingiverse does
